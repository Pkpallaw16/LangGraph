# 🧠 LangGraph-Based Agentic Workflow

This project demonstrates how to use **LangGraph**, a stateful, agentic framework built on top of LangChain, to design AI workflows that go beyond simple chains. It showcases graph-based reasoning with memory, conditional task execution, and multi-step interactions between agents and tools.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🤖 **Agentic Execution** – Combine multiple LLM-powered nodes into meaningful, stateful workflows
- 🧠 **Memory Persistence** – Enable contextual memory across transitions using LangChain memory stores
- 🔁 **Conditional Branching** – Build flexible graphs with dynamic edge routing and decision-making
- 🛠️ **Modular Design** – Easily extend each node/tool to fit your use case (summarization, QA, generation)
- 📊 **Traceable Graph Flows** – Monitor transitions, agent decisions, and outputs for debugging and explainability
